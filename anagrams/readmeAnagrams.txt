ANAGRAMS
From WIKI - 
An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Below are two programs, one in PERL and the other a NODE JS app that attempts to find all anagrams (case insensitive) of words. It prints the group of anagram words that contain the most words first then continues to print the rest descending in count.

dictionary file = /usr/share/dict/words

nodejs source - ./anagrams.js
nodejs run script - ./runAnagrams.js
nodejs output - ./out.txt

perl source - ./anagrams.pl
perl output - ./out_perl.txt
